A terminal script to have a dancing fortnite emote.

## Why??
Well, I saw these in a copy pasta on reddit and figured I would try and animate them. I started with using just a bash script to print out all the .txt files.
BUT! Then I remembered about parrot.live and parrot-terminal and figured I would try and do the same thing!
...So that is what I am going to do....
